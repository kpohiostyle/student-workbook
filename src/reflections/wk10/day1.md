Read Foundations of C# > C# Data Types and answer the following questions
## What are the three categories of data types? How are they different?
    Value Type: These data types directly contain values
    Reference Type: does not store its value directly, instead it stores the address where the value is being stored.
    Pointer Type: Pointer types do not inherit from object and no conversions exist between pointer types and object.

## What are the Value-type data types? What differences do you notice from JavaScript?
    They are the data types we use to declare what a value is, like bool, int, float, double. The biggest diffence is that there are a lot more of them. Especially when it comes to numbers, you have decimal, int, uint, long, etc, etc. They all have a storage value.

## In your own words how do Reference types get stored in memory? How does this differ from Value types?
    Well they get stored randomly, the system gives them a random location in the memory and the value is a memory address of the actual data value.
