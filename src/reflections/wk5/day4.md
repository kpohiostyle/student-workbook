## What is a virtual property?
    It is a additional field for a given model, these virtual properties do not persist in the database. Their values can be set manually or given functionality to set it automatically
## When might you use a virtual property?
    If by chance you have two differnt input fields but want to use those fields to combine into one, the example given was getting a persons first name and last name then using that create a persons full name.
## How do you search by a virtual properties value?
    I would assume by using getters and setters to obstain the info you want to either combine or spilt apart.
