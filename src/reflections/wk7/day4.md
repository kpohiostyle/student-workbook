# Day 4
## Daily Journal
 Reflect on your partner project and answer the following questions
## Which principles from this weeks reading did you implement?
    The big principles that I believe we implemented were from the Design a Strong User Experience, steps 3 and 4. Because of how many layers their were we needed to sketch out how we wanted to drill down and how we wanted the user to understand what they were doing. And testing was so we could clearly know what was being rendered to the page.
## What went well?
    This was by far my best experience working with a partner, open communication was so valuble. I had a few different ah ha moments were things began to make sense. We were constantly writing out our to-dos and making connections between the various parent-child relationships.
## What would you do differently?
    I would of liked to switch off between driver and navigator more often. I kind of took the driver role over which may have been unfair to Daniel and to myself. The other thing would of been added different layers of styling throughout the project instead of trying to do it all at the end
