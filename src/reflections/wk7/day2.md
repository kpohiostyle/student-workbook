## What is Code Documentation? What are some of the ways to document code?
    Code documentation is way of noting your code so others and yourself can understand what is going on in the code. Use of code documentation includes adding a readme, howtos guides.
## What are some benefits of Code Documentation?
    Some benefits include understanding what parameters a function is taking in. What return value you are getting from a funciton. With code documention you will also help you over time, if you move past a section of code for a certain length of time and have to refer it again later. Good code documention will allow you to understand what it was doing faster.
## How important is Code documentation and why?
    It would be great if code could be written in a human language but its not, its still a machine language and therefore not always the easiest to understand at first. Thats why code doumentation is so important, it bridges the gaps of understanding between human and machine speak.
