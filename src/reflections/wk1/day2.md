# Day2 - Review of HTML/CSS

## Daily Journal

Read Building Blocks Of Web Development > CSS and answer the following questions
## 1. What is a Pseudo-Class and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use

    A Pseudo-Class is used to change a value of an select. Buttons, input fields, and links are some of the more common selectors to change.

## 2.What is Specificity and how might you use it to your benefit?
    To me this is a style heirachy, like if you want one element to be different from the rest. You can use this to draw the users attention to it.

## 3. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the !important feature?
    I could see some common problems would be that it would make your code look messy, it would make changing your code difficult, and cause anyone looking at your code to question why its being used so often.
