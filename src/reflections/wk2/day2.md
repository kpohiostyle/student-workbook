# Day 2 - Javascript Functions, Objects, and Loops

## Daily Journal

Read Intro to JS > JavaScript Functions and answer the following questions

## What are the three ways to syntactically write a function? What are the differences in how the function acts (if any)?
    Function Declaration - is a named function, these are hoisted so they can be used before they are defined
    Function Expressions - because they are not hoisted they cannot be used before they are defined
    Arrow Function Expression - are the same as Function Expressions just use shorter syntax

## What is the difference between Parameters and Arguments?
    Arguments are passed into the definition of the function and the paramaters are created in the function definition.

## What are higher order functions? Can you provide an example?
