# Day 3 - Interacting With The Dom And Events

## Daily Journal

Read Intro to JS > Chrome Developer Tools and answer the following questions

## What are the main ways to write information to the console? Why/when should you use each style.

## Which tab allows you to see the breakdown of HTML/CSS and how can this tab be useful when debugging HTML?
    You can make updates and see the changes immediately, and you can highlight your elements to check if ending tags are in the wrong place or check that everything lines up in mobile view
## Outside of writing everything to the console, what is a better way to debug your code?
    I would say putting in a debugger in your code, this way it puts a pause on your code so you can step through it one line at a time to see what it actually doing.
