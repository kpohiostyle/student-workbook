# Day 1 - Intro to JavaScript Syntax

## Daily Journal
Read Intro to JS > Var, let and const and answer the following questions

## What is Scope ?
    Scope is the location where variables can be accessed. Like global scope can be used anywhere, local scope means it can be used within the function and block scope is a variable can be used within {}.

## What is Hoisting?
    Hoisting in JavaScript is pushing variables and declarations to the top of their respective scopes before other code is executed.

## In what cases might you use let vs const vs var?
    Uses of let would be used inside a block of code where a variable could be changed. Whereas const is a variable that is never changed by other code. We can only change the contents of a constant object. You would use var in cases where you would need a global variable or a function variable.
