# Day 2 - HTTP requests continued

## Daily Journal
Read Asynchronous Code > JavaScript Promises and answer the following questions
## What are the three states of a Promise?
    Pending, Resolved, Rejected
## How do promises seek to resolve the issues of "callback hell"?
    Promises use chaining. Which means your first call should occur, after that the second call can be called, then a third and so on. The chaining part occurs because you can add callbacks within the responses 
## What is the difference between .then() and .catch()?
    Then then method is called for something to happen after a successful Promise. The cath on the other hand is for catching a rejected Promise.
