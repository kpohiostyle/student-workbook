## What does REST stand for, and in simple terms what does it mean?
    Representational State Transfer simply put it means that when a "restful api" is called, the server sends representation of the state of info to the client
## What does Stateless mean?
    Stateless means that the server is clueless. It means it doesn't remember anything of the user that uses the API, or what parts of the API that user used. Everything the server needs to complete a request is kept in each individual request.
## What URL pattern is used when writing a RESTful API?
    The URL pattern used is the an identifier for the resource, i.e endpoint. The opperation you want the server to perform on that resource.
