# Day 3 - Working with multiple API's

## Daily Journal
Read Asynchronous Code > Async and Await and answer the following questions
## What is the purpose of Async/Await?
    It was introduced to reduce complexity and syntax complexity of Promises.
    You append Async to a function and then await in the properties. This lets your code know to keep going then come back when the promise is either fulfilled or rejected.
## What must you do in order to await a promise inside of a function?
    Append the word await to the code you need to wait on. for example await someService.function(). Therefore we know that it is waiting for a service to finish before it renders then function
## What are some of the primary benefits of Async/Await?
    Using Async/Await, makes the code much more readable, async can be used with multiple awaits. Using this practice also makes debugging code a lot easier as well.
