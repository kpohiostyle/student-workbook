Read Frontend Frameworks with Vue3 > Understanding VueJs Lifecycle Hooks and answer the following questions
## What are lifecycle hooks? What are lifecycle hooks used for?
    Lifecycle hooks are a window into how the library you're using works behind-the-scenes. Lifecycle hooks allow you to know when your component is created, added to the DOM, updated, or destroyed.
## How have you utilized lifcycle hooks in your afternoon projects?
    Im not sure I've used them in my afternoon challenges yet.
## What are mounting hooks? When might you use them?
    They allow you to access your component immediately before and after the first render. They do not, however, run during server-side rendering. You would use mounting hooks if you needed access to the DOM immediately before or after initial render.
