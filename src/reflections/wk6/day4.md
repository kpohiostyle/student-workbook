## Daily Journal
Read Frontend Frameworks with Vue3 > Using Nested Routes in Vue.js and answer the following questions
## What is a nested route?
    Nested routes allow for more complex user interfaces with components nested inside each other.
## When might you use a nested route? (other than the provided example)
    Possibly if you were on a movie/tv show site(like syfy.com) and wanted to see their movies and shows. But then add routes to take you to when these movies or shows would be streaming.
## Can you pass parameters through nested routes? When might you use them?
    Yes, you would use them when accessing certain data like photos or comments.
