# Day 1 - Intro to VueJS

## Daily Journal
Read Frontend Frameworks with Vue3 > Understanding Component Based Architecture and answer the following questions
## What is Component based architecture?
    Component based architecture is a method for encapsulating individual pieces of a larger user interface into self-sustaining independent micro-systems.
## What are some benefits of Component based architecture?
    Some of the benifits I saw would be the ease of which you call to methods, functions, and objects because they are all in the same file. Another positive I noticed was that with CBA those components you are creating are reusable. 
## What are some drawbacks to Component based architecture?
    One drawback would be the because there is a posibility that the readability could become difficult, because we are encapsulating all the responsibilities on one page. The other issue is the potential for over engineering.
