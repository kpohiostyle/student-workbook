## Day 1 Daily Journal
Afternoon Project: Working on Capstone

Reflect on your capstone project so far and answer the following questions

## What technologies and principles are you using in your project?
    For us the most important principles that we are implimenting is a mobile first approach. We want people to be able to use this app on the go. We are using Vue, Node, mongoDB, CSS to name a few.

## What went well so far?
    Planning the core functionality has really helped us stay consistant and driven. Also having that daily stand up to help us what we need to do next and what we are currently working on helped us in clarity a lot.

## What would you do differently? Why?
    When we hit a choke point, we put a lot of the work load on one person and it was really difficult to get out of that. Also, its been really hard to have an opinion heard when one member already has what they want to do planted in their head.
