# Day 1 INHERITANCE AND INTERFACES
## Daily Journal
Read Foundations of C# > C# Inheritance and answer the following questions
## What does Inheritance accomplish for us in C#?
    Inheritance allows a developer to describe a relationship between two classes. The two classes involved are the derived class and the base class.
## How does Member inheritance work in C#? Does a class inherit all members of the base class?
   Depending on how that member is declared depends on how it is inherited. Private members cannnot be seen therefore cannot me inherited. Not everything is inherited, Constructors are not inheritable. Finalizers are also not inherited.
## How does accessibility affect inheritance?
    Private members in the parent class cannot be accessed by the child class. The work around to that is if you nest the child class within the parent class
