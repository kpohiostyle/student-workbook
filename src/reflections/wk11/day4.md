# Day 4 Full-Stack Review
## Daily Journal
## Write a review and reflection of your experiences in this course, as this is the last lecture before your final project, what are your concerns, how do you plan to manage your time, what have you enjoyed most about the course up to this point.

   If im answering this question truthfully. I have no idea if I even want to be a developer anymore, I enjoy writing code a lot. But this course has made me hate myself at times, the network checkpoint broke me and I haven't recovered from it since. I've stumbled my way through this since. And if thats what its like out there in field, I dont know if I want any part of that. So yeah, about managing my time. I'll work on it over the long weekend the goal is 6-8 hours a day and I know I can do that because I don't have any distractions
