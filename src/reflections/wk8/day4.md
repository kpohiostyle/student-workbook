Read Working In a Professional Environment > Testing in Vue and answer the following questions
## What are the three main types of testing we can accomplish in Vue? What does each method provide?
    Unit Testing - this allows your to test individual units of code in isolation.
    Component Testing - allows testing to happen with Vue integrations such as Vuex, Vue Router.
    End to End Testing - this testing allows a more user experience testing. From start to finish of the user.
## What testing method do you think is the most useful? Why?
    Probably the unit testing would be most useful. Because this is where we are isolating the individual units to ensure they are working correctly so when they are all brought together in theory should still all work.
## What testing method do you think is the least useful? Why?
    Probably component testing would be least useful. I think maybe because testing with the conveniences of may not be able to pinpoint any edge cases you may find in your code.
