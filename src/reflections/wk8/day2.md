## Daily Journal
Read Working In a Professional Environment > Scrum for Small Teams and answer the following questions
## Why is communication on a small team important?
    A smaller team may need to work harder to deliver a project by a deadline. Clear communication keeps a small team on the same page and moving forward with the goals of the project.
## What adjustments from traditional sized scrum teams need to be made to use the agile methodology effectively in a small team?
    Possibly the idea of needing to learn a new skill to help in sharing responisbilies. Also that sometimes one person may have multiple roles within the team.
## What is the unattainable triangle? What are the tradeoffs of each side?
    This is the tradeoff between time, money, quality. If you want it fast, the quality may be less than satisfactory. If you want high quality it will cost a lot of money and take more time. If you want cheap, quality will be poor.
