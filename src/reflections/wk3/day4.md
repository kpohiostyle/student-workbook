# Day 4 - Working in MVC with Complex Data, Array Methods
## Daily Journal
Read Advancing with JS > The Observer Pattern and answer the following questions
## What problems does the Observer Pattern seek to solve?
    Some problems are when you have input that you want to move into different components, which could use a lot of pull and pull. Or in development speech one-to-many data binding between elements.
## What are the three mechanisms of the observer pattern?
    Subscribe, unsubscribe, and broadcast
## Review the code generated from the bcw-template and reflect on the proxy objects from yesterday, and your understanding of the observer pattern today. With this knowledge, explain how the magic of the bcw-template uses these two concepts to manage and update the dom.
    If I remember correctly, the magic is that when we have one input of data but need to use that data in serveral different places, using proxystate helps move the references of that data to where we need it without actually using the data.
