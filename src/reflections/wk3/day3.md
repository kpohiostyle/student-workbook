## Daily Journal
Read Advancing with JS > An Intro to Javascript Proxy Objects and answer the following questions
## What are the two common operations that we will set in the handler?
    Get and Set
## What do you have to make sure you are doing with every Get to insure the value does not become undefined?
    every get takes two parameters, the object itself and the property being accessed
## What are some of the benefits of the proxy object that we are using in our structure for applications?
    Some of the benefits are we only have to pass the reference of what the Proxy is accessing, another is that Proxy can be used over and over to grab information without having to rewrite the code. Like we can use it to grab items in a lists array and an items array.
