# Day 2 - Encapsulation
## Daily Journal
Read Advancing with JS > Encapsulation in JavaScript and answer the following questions
## What is the purpose of Encapsulation?
    To set a specific set of code with restictions only on that data and its methods, by storing the data privately. Further more it is to resolve timing issues of data being passed because of a fixed amount of memory to be used.
## What were some of the problems with closures and the underscore prefix?
    One problem is that new developers are unaware of what the underscore prefix means and use the properties, on the other hand many experienced developers know what it means but kind of ignore it and use them anyway.
    Adding public API's can give more oppurtunities to hackers to attack the system.

## How do we create private variables in a ES6 Class? Why would you do this?
    By using a privileged methos, which has only referenced access to the properties.
